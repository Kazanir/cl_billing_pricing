# Commerce License Billing Pricing #

Commerce License Billing Pricing provides a new field type which allows custom pricing logic to be applied to the recurring charges generated by the Commerce License Billing module.

This field type can be applied to license bundles or user accounts and handles various license-related conditions, possible pricing actions, and expiration handling all within the UI of the new field type.

## Getting started ##

1. Install as usual. See https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/extending-drupal-7/installing-contributed-modules-find-import-enable-configure-drupal-7 for details.
2. To apply pricing logic to a user, go to admin/config/people/accounts/fields and add a field type "Recurring license pricing options".
3. Edit the field and choose to which license types will the pricing logic be applied.
4. Saving and returning to the edit for will open additional field "Licensable products". It will list all the products matching chosen license types and allow narrowing down available options in the widget. _Optional step._
5. Edit a user profile. The new field will allow custom pricing logic.
